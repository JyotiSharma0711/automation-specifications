# master search — Sequence Diagrams

Internal data file consumed by the Developer Guide's "Sequence Diagram" tab (API Walkthrough).
Not meant to be shown as its own docs page — the frontend filters this slug out of the Use Case
Brief / Additional Resources / Changelog tab lists and instead looks up the section matching the
selected API call's `action_id` (the `##` heading below) to render that step's diagram.

One `## <action_id>` heading per step of `master_search.yaml`, in that flow's own step order, each
followed by its Mermaid `sequenceDiagram`.

## search_1

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  title Personal Loan Discovery
  rect rgb(191, 223, 255)
  Borrower Platform (BAP)->>Gateway (BG): search
  Gateway (BG) ->> Borrower Platform (BAP): ACK
  Gateway (BG)->>Registry: Lookup Lender Platforms (lookup)
  Registry->>Gateway (BG): List of Lender Platforms (200 OK)
  Gateway (BG)->>Lender Platform(BPP): search
  Lender Platform(BPP)->>Gateway (BG) : ACK
  end
  Lender Platform(BPP)->>Borrower Platform (BAP): Publish Catalog of Lender 1 (on_search)
  Borrower Platform (BAP)->>Lender Platform(BPP): ACK
```
